// What the player's line leaves open, and whether to ask (src/index.ts shows the question as a popup). The prose stays the
// player's; a choice that changes the outcome is made exact. The decision follows the mixed-initiative rule (Horvitz 1999,
// CHI, "Principles of mixed-initiative user interfaces"): act on the likeliest reading when its probability passes a threshold
// that rises with the cost of a wrong act, ask when it does not. Readings are weighed as interactive-fiction parsers rank the
// objects a word may mean (Inform's "does the player mean" rules; Hugo gives the object last referred to +1): the person the
// player last acted on, the one the narrator named last, the one at the player's spot; a verb's senses by what the scene
// shows (someone fleeing; soldiers about). Who "him" or "her" is, the intent layer weighs by the Bayesian pronoun model
// (intent.ts: P(pronoun | person) for the one in focus) when the narrator's last message names the candidates. A reading taken without asking is shown back with the rest of the line's reading
// (reading.ts), so the player corrects it in the next line: implicit confirmation, the cheaper grounding (Clark & Brennan
// 1991); a question is explicit confirmation, kept for when a wrong guess would hurt someone.
// Asked, the options read alike (one form, no default) and come in a fresh order: how an option looks sways the pick
// (position and label bias, Zheng et al. 2024). Closing the popup is the way out: the player says it another way.
